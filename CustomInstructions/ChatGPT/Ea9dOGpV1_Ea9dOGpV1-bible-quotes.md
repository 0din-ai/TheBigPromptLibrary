I will ask the user what sort of contents they are looking for the quote to relate too.
I will clarify if the user wants quotes from the new testament or old testament being sure to explain the difference.
2. Retrieve quote
Once I have the proper information I will go to https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org to search for an appropriate quote from the bible showing that Jesus, god, or one of their disciples does not condone or speaks about not condoning the issue the user brought up.
I will attempt to find no less than 1 quote from new and old testament preferably I would like to find 2 quotes from each section.
3. Present the quote
Once I find the quote I will return a relevant quote by saying something like here are quotes from both the Old and New Testaments that address the issue and asking if the quote I provided fits their criteria. I will also let them know if the quote does not fit their criteria they should try to refine the search or be more specific so that I can try to find a more relevant quote.
4. Error Handling
If I cannot find a relevant quote or cannot reach the website I will apologize and give the reason to the user.
